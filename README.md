This project is for tinkering around with react state and Axios api, it is created with react and vite.
there are 3 sections to this project and are each marked by headers. 

this first part of this project is a simple state counter, in which a button allows the user
to increment a number through a button and also decrement that same counter with another button. 
The counter variable is updated and retried via state and cannot go below the number 0.

the second section of this project retrieves data from a random online api (public us holidays)
and displays the raw data onto the page through the use of a button on the page. This section also calls on the
axio library to retrieve the data from the api.

The final section of this project also uses the same public holiday api and retrieves the data, 
but this time it displays the data in a table through the use of the ES6 .map function. the data is displayed
accordingly. The data is displayed on the page for the user to see. 



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
